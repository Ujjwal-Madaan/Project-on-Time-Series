# Time Series
This repository helps in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset of nearly 25Kms

## Objective-
A dataset is given, in which the data is given according to the time, i.e. year. Thus using the concept of time series, we have to find the data of the last given year. 

## Methodology Used-
Markup: * Preprocessing of data
        * Splitting the data into Training and Testing set. Testing data is the 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section.
        * Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn library is applied for this purpose. 
            * It is the type of model which is used in the Supervised Machine Learning Regression problems. It builds a regression model in the form of a tree structure. It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The algorithm employs a top-down, greedy search through the space of possible branches with no backtracking to predict the output.

## Results
The RMSE value of the model is 27.38.
